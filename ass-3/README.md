task-1 Calculate Factorial Using a Function 
in the code i use recursion method (when the function is called itself in the function is known as recurssion )
first i make a function named factorial used a argument 
then use if statement for 0! and 1! so its return value 1 if the user write 0 or 1 
else return value a * factorial(a-1)
then use input method to get the value of a in function
