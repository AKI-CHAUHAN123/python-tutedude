task 1: read file and error handling
The code tries to open a file named file.txt in read mode.

If the file exists, it reads the entire content and stores it in a variable.

If the file doesn't exist, a FileNotFoundError occurs.

The program then prints an error message instead of crashing.

task 2:Write and Append Data to a File

The program asks the user to enter text and writes it to output.txt using write mode ("w"), replacing any existing content.

It then takes another input from the user and appends it to the same file using append mode ("a").

After writing and appending, the program opens the file in read mode ("r").

It reads the entire content of the file and stores it in a variable.

Finally, the complete content of the file is printed on the screen.
